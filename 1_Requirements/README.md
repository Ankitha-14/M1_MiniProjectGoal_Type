# Identifying Features
  Calculates using math operators for easy purpose.
 # State of Art
 The main purpose is to calculate mathematical calculations.
 # Requirements
  The Mini project is the application to calculate using calculator. The tool used for writing the code in this project is visual studio code. This project has multi file and multiplatform approach.
     • Key to store the entered keys
     • Expression to store the Expression string to be processed
     • Display to show the entered keys and the calculation result
     • Result to store the last result
             
 
 
 
# Swot Analysis 
 * Strength:
               The ultimate strength of Calculators is innovative and user-friendly products. Calculators are long-lasting, and they have almost all kinds of calculators such as basic, scientific, graphing, financial, etc.
  * Weakness:
              It is Simplified to some limit.
                
  * Oppurtunity:
              Implemented and used in our daily activities.
  * Threat:
             Has to be implemented more regarding operators.
