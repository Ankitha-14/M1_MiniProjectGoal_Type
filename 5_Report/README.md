     • Expression to store the Expression string to be processed
     • Display to show the entered keys and the calculation result
     • Result to store the last result
             
 
 
 
# Swot Analysis 
 * Strength:
               The ultimate strength of Calculators is innovative and user-friendly products. Calculators are long-lasting, and they have almost all kinds of calculators such as basic, scientific, graphing, financial, etc.
  * Weakness:
              It is Simplified to some limit.
                
  * Oppurtunity:
              Implemented and used in our daily activities.
  * Threat:
             Has to be implemented more regarding operators.
